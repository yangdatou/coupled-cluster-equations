# coupled-cluster-equations
This is a _stupied_ implementation of coupled-cluster equations in python. It is not optimized but it is easy to understand. It is a good starting point for people who want to learn to derive the coupled-cluster equations.

All the equations are derived by a modified version of [`wick`](https://github.com/yangdatou/wick/tree/dev) package, which could formulate the derived equations to the `einsum` format.

# Dependencies
- `numpy`
